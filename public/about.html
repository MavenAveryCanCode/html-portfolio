<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />

<p><h5></h5>
  <h3>I am finally fulfilling my desire to become a developer at 41.</h3>This haunted me since I was 17 when syntax has to be written without shortcuts and each tag has to memorized. The idea of how computer processes data amazes me. Im curious about how a computer "thinks." Ill probably be learning to develop softwares after mastering web development.</p> 
  <p><h3>I am a wife and a mother of four girls</h3>. But realizing my potential and how boring my farm life is, I took several online courses thinking that making more money and skills will add thrill to my unspiced life. I took an online class on becoming an Amazon FBA virtual Assistant, another one to start a career as a freelancer which taught me graphic design, social media management, several data entry and digital marketing skills while looking after my four girls.<h3>The truth is that not until you do what makes your soul happy,</h3> you will not see life in a colorful lens. In between my children's homeworks and household chores, I design events and do paper and ribbon crafting. I am a philomath, a language and literature teacher, a singer  who still dreams of learning to play the piano. I own three Persian cats. I love flowers such lilies, tulips and orchids. </p>
<p>I still have a long list of things I want to learn and do in life. I want to have a well-lived existence being a visual artist, designer and creator, who touches other people's lives through my works and contributes to making the world a better place.  I am a lot more other things but above all else, <h3>I operate on the frequency of love.</h3></p>
